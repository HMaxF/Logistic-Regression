# Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression demo using heart disease dataset 
* from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

# Learning steps:
1. Get the data to make the model
2. Analyze the dataset by visualize it in:
    - Histograms of Features.
    - Correlation Matrix.
3. Predict the trained data and the unseen data, visualize the results in:
    - Confusion Matrix
    - ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve

# Requirement
- Jupyter notebook (https://jupyter.org/)
- Python 3.8+
- Matplotlib
- ipympl # only for interative 3D plot in browser

# How to run
- In command line, example:
```
$ python3 predict-heart-disease.py heart-disease-from-kaggle-johnsmith88.csv
```
- In Jupyter notebook: predict-heart-disease.ipynb

# Notes
- The .ipynb has full python code similar to the .py
- Load .ipynb either in VS Code or in browser using Jupyter Notebook
- Inside .ipynb there is Matplotlib to visualize the data for better understanding of Logistic Regression.
